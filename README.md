# comminucation

Hello Rafal how are you ?
I am back from Malta, I worked at EASO (european agency for asylum)
I had the chance to create from scratch the new website https://euaa.europa.eu/
D3.js was a pleasure to play with.

I am more advanced in Angular now and EUI (You remember when I install it the first time?) 
I assume you use it now.

Anyway, I'm looking for a job now in Brussels.
If you have something in mind please tell me :)

Regards,

Luca
